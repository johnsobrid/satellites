satellites
==========
Satellites is a program designed to enable a user to control mechatronic devices with an iOS device. It's still in its very early stages, but ultimately it will likely be able to send a variety of OSC commands to a server. At that point, the problem is out of this program's hands, but the server may convert the messages to MIDI or other serial communications protocol to interface with a microcontroller and any attached actuators.
